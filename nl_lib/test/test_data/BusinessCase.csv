The business does not have the capability to provide virtual services such as online chat with potential or current Guests logged on the cruise line website. The ability to communicate via web chat, provide agent to Guest e-mail, and identify callers to client history would improve communications, provide differentiated services, and enhance call center efficiency.",,,DCL,DCL,,,,,,,58,,,,,,Not Active,,Not Active,3350,Not Active,,,,,,,Item,14905,58;1989;2633,2633,4121,,,,9/16/2013,"Drew, Fred",4/1/2009,"McNair, Andrea",sites/methods1/Lists/Business Case/3_.000,sites/methods1/Lists/Business Case,0,https://wdpr.sharepoint.disney.com/sites/methods1/Lists/Business%20Case/3_.000,
